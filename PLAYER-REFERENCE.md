## ROLLING DICE

### The Basics
Roll **Attribute + Skill** in d6s. Each **5 or 6 = 1 Hit**.

| Hits | What Happens |
|:----:|--------------|
| 0 | **Failure** — Things go wrong |
| 1 | **Partial Success** — You do it, but there's a cost or complication |
| 2 | **Success** — You accomplish your goal |
| 3+ | **Strong Success** — Bonus effect, extra damage, or advantage |

### Exploding Sixes
Each **6** you roll gives you **+1 bonus die** (roll it immediately). Max +3 bonus dice per roll.

### Critical Failure
If **more than half** your dice show 1s AND you have no hits = something catastrophic happens.

### Pushing Your Luck
After any roll, you may **Push** — reroll all dice that didn't show hits.
- Each **1** on the Push = **1 Stress**
- You **must** accept the new result
- Can't Push a Push

---

## GUTS

Your meta-currency for desperate moments.

### Each Session
- **Start**: 3 Guts
- **Earn**: Up to +2 more (see triggers below)
- **Maximum**: 5

Track earned this session: [ ] [ ] — stop earning when both marked.

### Spend 1 Guts To...
| Use | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Reroll** | Reroll a failed roll (0 hits). No Stress from 1s — clean second chance. |
| **Reduce Damage** | Take 2 less damage (after armor). Declare after damage is rolled. |
| **Find What You Need** | Discover a useful item, escape route, or opportunity. GM can veto absurdity. |
| **Just Enough** | You have exactly 1 round of ammo, 1 dose of medicine, or 1 use left. |
| **Last Stand** | Ignore all wound penalties for one roll. |
| **Flashback** | Declare a past preparation (see Flashbacks below). |

---

## FLASHBACKS

Spend **1 Guts** to declare something you prepared earlier.

### Simple Flashback (Auto-Success)

- Told someone a meeting place
- Scouted a route you could have taken
- Memorized available information

### Complex Flashback (Requires Roll)
- Set up a trap or distraction (Craft)

If the roll fails, Guts is still spent but the preparation went wrong.

### Never Allowed

## COMBAT

### Your Turn
| Type | What You Get |
|------|--------------|
| **Action** | Attack, reload, use item, maneuver, complex task |
| **Move** | One range band (or reposition within a zone) |
| **Free** | Speak briefly, drop item, draw holstered weapon |

### Trading Actions
- **Move → Action**: Take two Actions, but you're **Exposed** (+1 die to attacks against you)
- **Action → Move**: Take two Moves (good for fleeing)

### Attack Rolls
| Attack Type | Roll |
|-------------|------|

## DEFENSE OPTIONS

You don't have to just take hits.

| Defense | Cost | How It Works |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Passive** | Nothing | Attacker just rolls. Default if you do nothing. |
| **Active Defense** | Your Action | Roll REFLEX + Athletics. Each hit cancels one attacker hit. |
| **Dive for Cover** | Your Move | Get behind nearby cover immediately. Gain cover bonus. |
| **Parry** (melee only) | Your Action | Roll GRIT + Brawl. Cancel hits. On 2+ hits, free counterattack at -1 die! |

*If you use Active Defense or Parry before your turn, you've spent your Action — you only have Move and Free when your turn comes.*

---

## COMBAT MANEUVERS

Beyond basic attacks:

| Maneuver | Roll | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Grapple** | GRIT + Brawl vs their GRIT + Brawl | Win = target is Grappled. Can then Choke or Throw. |
| **Escape** (when grappled) | GRIT + Brawl or REFLEX + Athletics vs their GRIT + Brawl | Win = break free |
| **Disarm** | GRIT + Brawl | 2+ hits = weapon flies away. 1 hit = drops at feet. |
| **Shove** | GRIT + Athletics | 2+ hits = push them one zone (into hazards = bonus damage) |
| **Tackle** | GRIT + Brawl (after moving) | +1 die from momentum. Hit = damage + Prone or Grappled. You're Exposed. |
| **Called Shot** | -1 or -2 dice | Target specific body part for special effects (see below) |

## WOUNDS

No hit points — you have a wound track.

### Your Wound Track
```
BRUISED     [ ][ ][ ][ ] + bonus    No penalty
BLEEDING    [ ][ ][ ]               -1 die after combat
BROKEN      [ ][ ]                  -2 dice after combat
CRITICAL    [ ]                     Dying (10 min to stabilize)
```
**Bonus Bruised slots** = GRIT - 2 (minimum 0)

### Taking Damage
Damage determines wound severity. Mark the leftmost empty slot at that level. If full, **escalate** to next level.

| Damage | Wound Level |
|:------:|-------------|
| 1-2 | Bruised |
| 3-4 | Bleeding |
| 5-6 | Broken |
| 7+ | Critical |

### Penalties Are Delayed
**Adrenaline Window**: Wound penalties don't apply during combat. They kick in **10 minutes after combat ends**.

**Penalty Cap**: Maximum -3 dice total, even with multiple wounds.

### Patch Up
Spend 1 Action + bandage to suppress a Bleeding or Broken wound's penalty for 1 hour. Doesn't heal it, just masks the pain.

### Armor
Armor **reduces damage** before determining wound severity.

| Armor | Reduction |
|-------|:---------:|
| Heavy Clothing | 1 |
| Light Armor | 2 |
| Heavy Armor | 3 |

## INFECTION

### What Triggers an Infection Check
- Bitten by infected
- Infected blood in open wound
- Infected blood in eyes or mouth
- Grappled by infected for 2+ rounds (they WILL bite)

### The Check

| 1 | **Fighting it.** Symptoms in 1d6×10 minutes. Second check at -2 dice or turn. |
| 2+ | **Clear.** This time. (Still take 1 Stress from the fear.) |

### Protection
- **Face covering**: Blocks blood spray to face
- **Long sleeves/gloves**: First scratch/bite to arms = damage only, no infection check
- **Heavy jacket/armor**: First bite to torso = damage only

### Amputation
If bitten on a limb, **immediate amputation** (within 60 seconds) = automatic success.
- Requires someone to roll WITS + Medicine or you take a Critical wound from blood loss
- You lose the limb permanently

### Blood Spray
When you kill an infected in melee: Roll d6. On 1-3 = blood spray.

## SURVIVAL TIPS

1. **Stealth first.** The best fight is the one you avoid.
2. **Track your ammo.** Every bullet matters.
3. **Stick together.** Flanking gives +1 die. Being alone gets you killed.
4. **Use the environment.** Shove enemies into hazards. Use cover.
5. **Don't get bitten.** Infection is nearly always fatal.
6. **Protect your face.** Blood spray is an infection risk.
7. **Patch wounds fast.** Use that adrenaline window.
8. **Save Guts for emergencies.** But don't hoard it — it resets anyway.
9. **Ghost Runs earn Guts.** Sometimes sneaking past is the real win.
10. **Know when to run.** There's no shame in retreat.
